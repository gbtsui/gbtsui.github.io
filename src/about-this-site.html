                    <p>Hi! This is the website that I made, again.
                        I made this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, like a classic
                        beginner web developer. I'll refactor it into React someday
                        if I need it. I wrote all of the code in VSCode and sometimes 
                        just editing raw on GitHub if I was desperate. In this article,
                        I'll detail basically how I made all of this! (also, no, just because
                        all of the pages look similar does not mean that i copy pasted it
                        a morbillion times)
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why didn't I use a website creator like a normal person?</h2>
                    <p>While services like Wix and Squarespace are pretty cool for companies
                        and stuff, for just a personal little website with nothing important
                        hosted on GitHub, it's completely unnecessary. This was also free to
                        make and host. Also, it's completely customizable since I have full 
                        control over what goes on here instead of being restrained to whatever
                        a template forces me to use. It's kind of like why I use Arch (btw),
                        complete customizability and I also learn a lot by making this.

                    <h2>What tools did I use for this site?</h2>
                    <p>VSCode and the LiveServer extension. That's it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>What was the hardest part about making this?</h2>
                    <p>CSS is not very fun to work with. While it helps that LiveServer updates
                        on every save, sometimes things break completely for no discernible reason
                        and it's a bit difficult to make everything look exactly like you want it to.

                <div class = "informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>How is this site's directory structured?</h2>
                    <p>In the root <code>/</code> directory, there's the homepage <code>index.html</code>
                    and main CSS file <code>main_theme.css</code>. In <code>/res/</code>, there's a <code>
                    fonts</code> directory containing the two* TTF font files for the Atkinson fonts used 
                    in this website, and a <code>images</code> directory containing all of the pictures.<br>
                    In <code>/src/</code>, there's a <code>js/</code> folder containing all of the fun little
                    scripts used. At the time of writing, it only contains <code>cookies.js</code> which
                    creates the fun little peer pressure system that forces you to take a cookie. (This site
                    does not actually store cookies in your browser, it simply stores a bit of data in your
                    cache and clearing your cache allows you to take another cookie. I do not track any of
                    your personal information whatsoever.)<br>
                    As well, <code>/src/</code> also contains the main <code>.html</code> files that make up 
                    the individual pages in this site. There's not very much to it, this website is relatively
                    simple in structure. I like it that way, there's a lot less to manage.<br>
                    Also, there's a <code>README.md</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> for GitHub stuff. Not
                    very important in terms of the actual website, but if you go to the <a href="https://github.com/gbtsui/gbtsui.github.io">
                    repository</a> you can see stuff. 
                    </p>

                <div class="full-image">
                    <img src="/res/images/website-directory-layout.avif"/>
                    <p>Layout as of time of writing.</p>

                <div class = "informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>How are site pages themselves structured?</h2>
                    <p>I use typical HTML. In <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, I have a few main <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
                    blocks: <code>head_navbar</code> contains the top navigational link bar thingy, <code>top_area</code>
                    contains the title and subtitle, <code>fullwidth_text_block</code> contains the actual body of 
                    the actual body. As well, I also have a <code>footer</code> which contains... the footer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If you're really interested in how the website is built, I recommend inspecting the HTML yourself,
                        since there's a lot more <code>div</code> types than the main ones. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>Is my code pretty or clean?</h2>
                    <p>No. Not at all. Please do not follow exactly what I do for your own website, I make a lot
                        of mistakes in my formatting and stuff. I suggest reading up on common best practices on 
                        how people write HTML. Though, most sites these days are written in React, so unless you're 
                        also just making something barebones like me, I would stick to that.

                <div class="informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>How did I learn how to make this?</h2>
                    <p>Trial and error, which in retrospect isn't the greatest way to learn. But, I used documentation from 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, which was actually really really helpful. Trying
                        to learn HTML/CSS/JS by yourself with zero external documentation is a recipe for failure, which is why
                        documentation and stuff exists. Also, I might have copy and pasted stuff from Instagram reels that I've
                        watched about CSS. That's how you learn, though.

                I think I was like 13 years old when I first made this website. Please excuse the general messiness of it all, I'm working on fixing everything.</p>
