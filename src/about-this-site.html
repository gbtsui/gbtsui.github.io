                    <p>Hi! This is the website that I made, again.
                        I made this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, like a classic
                        beginner web developer. I'll refactor it into React someday
                        if I need it. I wrote all of the code in VSCode and sometimes 
                        just editing raw on GitHub if I was desperate. In this article,
                        I'll detail basically how I made all of this! (also, no, just because
                        all of the pages look similar does not mean that i copy pasted it
                        a morbillion times)
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why didn't I use a website creator like a normal person?</h2>
                    <p>While services like Wix and Squarespace are pretty cool for companies
                        and stuff, for just a personal little website with nothing important
                        hosted on GitHub, it's completely unnecessary. This was also free to
                        make and host. Also, it's completely customizable since I have full 
                        control over what goes on here instead of being restrained to whatever
                        a template forces me to use. It's kind of like why I use Arch (btw),
                        complete customizability and I also learn a lot by making this.

                    <h2>What tools did I use for this site?</h2>
                    <p>VSCode and the LiveServer extension. That's it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "informative-paragraph-section">
                    <h2>What was the hardest part about making this?</h2>
                    <p>CSS is not very fun to work with. While it helps that LiveServer updates
                        on every save, sometimes things break completely for no discernible reason
                        and it's a bit difficult to make everything look exactly like you want it to.

                    and main CSS file <code>main_theme.css</code>. In <code>/res/</code>, there's a <code>
                    fonts</code> directory containing the two* TTF font files for the Atkinson fonts used 
                    in this website, and a <code>images</code> directory containing all of the pictures.<br>
