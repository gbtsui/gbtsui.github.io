                    <p>Fractals are really cool. As a kid, I always loved them for some odd reason.
                        I used to draw Sierpinski triangles on the side of my math homework, watched
                        Mandelbrot set videos in Grade 7, even listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/FractalDreamers">
                        Fractal Dreamers</a> before I stopped for theological reasons. Recently, I learned
                        how to create and generate my own cool 3-dimensional fractals using a software
                        called Mandelbulber. These were my first attempts, which don't have the greatest 
                        resolution or quality, but I still think they're quite beautiful by virtue of their
                        infinite nature.

                    <h2>About Fractals</h2>
                    <p>Fractals are usually defined as self-similar infinitely recursive geometrical structures.
                        Unfortunately, I don't actually know enough math to properly do the subject justice. 
                        Every fractal that I know of is either generated through a recursive function or a naturally
                        occurring chaotic structure. Fractals usually have infinite perimeter unless they approach some 
                        value. Fun fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">coastine of Britain</a>
                        is a well-known fractal problem. Please read more about fractals elsewhere, I'm not very
                        good at explaining them, I just think they look pretty.

                    <img src="/res/images/cool-stuff/fractals/dodecahedron sponge.png"/>
                    <p>A poorly rendered Menger sponge, also called a Sierpinski sponge. It's a little grainy, since my PC didn't want to render any more of it.</p>

                    <img src="/res/images/cool-stuff/fractals/mandelbox scale -2.png" />
                    <p>A Mandelbox with a scale of -2. It actually contains approximations of other fractals inside of it, a property shared by the 2-dimensional Mandelbrot set.
                        I'm calling this one a Fractal Swiss Cheese due to its similarity.

                    <p>A close-up of a Mandelbulb generated with a power of 9. Basically a 3-dimensional version of the Mandelbrot set. The colors are so beautiful.</p>

                    <p>I don't even know what this is. It's called a "Pseudo-Kleinian" model, apparently. It reminds me of those old surreal memes with Stonks Man and Orang.
                        Also kind of looks like something that might be in the background of a vaporwave album cover.

                    <p>The classic Sierpinski triange, created in 3D but also as an icosahedron. It reminds me of an amethyst geode.</p>

                    <h2>What did I use to make this?</h2>
                    <p>I did this all on my beautiful potato called the ThinkPad T480. It has an i7-8650U processor, 32GB of RAM (wasn't particularly 
                        consequential in this program), and integrated graphics. (I use Arch, btw.) The software I used was <a href="https://github.com/buddhi1980/mandelbulber2">
                        Mandelbulber</a>, which could probably run on PCs that are more potato-ey than mine. It's pretty easy, actually.

                    <p>I might try making more with different materials, different functions, and more detailed images. For now, this is just a cool 
                        novelty with not much purpose whatsoever, but it's a very cool art project that I quite like a lot. If you enjoyed looking at these,
                        I recommend trying to generate some yourself!<br>
                        Art is beautiful, and math is art.
