# gbtsui's website

## Abstract

This is the website that I built for myself. It shows basic information about me and flexes my non-existent skills for potential employers
to scrutinize. I plan to add more stuff to it soon. I started making this site in like, November of 2023. So a lot of the older content still
shows signs of 14 year old me. Currently rewiring the whole site to be slightly more professional and look a little aesthetically nicer. 

## Why do I have a README?

Because HackClub makes me do that for some reason.

## What do I plan to add later?
### Pretty!!!!!
First of all, more CSS styling. It's actually pretty fun for some reason, since I'm not the greatest at visual design but I like writing rules
for how my stuff is supposed to look through code. Maybe some more dynamic animations?<br>
### Functions
Might eventually add a page directory, either through a folder system like how the files themselves are structured or through a floating node system
similar to my other project TaskTree and inspired by Obsidian graph view. That was already kind of a thing through the WWW Webgraph, but that was for 
the entire web. This would be built for my website exclusively. I don't know exactly how useful it would be, but it would be a fun exercise.
