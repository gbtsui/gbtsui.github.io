      <p>I'm a high school student (class of '27) learning programming, design, and some other cool
      things. Member of FRC4039 MakeShift. Also a math nerd, but I'm not actually good at anything
      so I just kind of chill. For more information, click <a href="gbtsui.github.io/about">here</a>.

      <p>Typeset in Atkinson Monolegible. Or should be, if your browser doesn't want to load it.
        HTML+CSS+JavaScript+React.js written by hand. Sorry for the mess - it's a work in progress
